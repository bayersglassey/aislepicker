* Mouse coords for canvas events are messed up when devtools is open (so... when window/canvas are squished?..)

* Runner needs start/stop/restart, loading JSON should restart before deserializing

* Need to be able to find shortest path between any two nodes!
    So, depth-first search or whatever it's going to be.

* Add a separate menu for picklist routing?.. it shows routes for selected picklist?..
    Pickplan + Pickroutes
    Pickschedule + Pickroutes
    ummm

    Keep in mind we want to be able to generate these automatically.
    Specifying e.g. "3 pickers, each picker handles max weight 5".
    Another approach would be to create pickers manually, and then
    assign each picker a set of nodes they're allowed to pick from...
    Representing store departments, basically.
