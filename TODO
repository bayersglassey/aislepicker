* If a node is used by a picklist item, and you remove the node from the graph,
    the picklist item still holds onto it.
    How do we handle this?
    Do we remove the picklist item?
    Do we remove the picklist?
    Do we disallow deletion of the node and show an error message?
        -> THIS

* Add a separate menu for picklist routing?.. it shows routes for selected picklist?..
    Pickplan + Pickroutes
    Pickschedule + Pickroutes
    ummm

    Keep in mind we want to be able to generate these automatically.
    Specifying e.g. "3 pickers, each picker handles max weight 5".
    Another approach would be to create pickers manually, and then
    assign each picker a set of nodes they're allowed to pick from...
    Representing store departments, basically.
