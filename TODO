* If a node is used by a picklist item, and you remove the node from the graph,
    the picklist item still holds onto it.
    How do we handle this?
    Do we remove the picklist item?
    Do we remove the picklist?
    Do we disallow deletion of the node and show an error message?
        -> THIS

* Store X: node labels should be aisles e.g. A1-S2-B4,
    picklist item labels should be products e.g. Pizza, Meat, etc.
    Picklist item labels should be rendered above/below node labels.
